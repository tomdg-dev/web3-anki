### What is web3?
A new decentralized version of the internet where users own and control their own data.

### What are the cons of web3 from a user perspective?
<b>Less convenient</b> - you're responsible for your own data, there's no "forgot password" button or customer service.
<br><b>Less privacy</b> - data can be encrypted but transactions are publicly verifiable, so patterns are publicly visible
<br><b>Less flexibility</b> - the blockchain is immutable, this means you can't change or delete things you've put on it
<br><strong>Legal ambiguity</strong>: uncertain jurisdiction, compliance requirements, and how existing laws apply to decentralized systems

### What are the upsides of web3?
<b>true ownership</b>: no company can delete your data or change the rules on you.
<br><b>censorship resistance</b>: your content and transactions can't be blocked, banned, or removed by governments or corporations.<br><b>global accessibility</b>: anyone with internet can participate<br><b>transparency</b>: all transactions and smart contract code are publicly verifiable, so you can see exactly how systems work.<br><b>composability</b>: applications can build on top of each other without permission, creating network effects<br>
