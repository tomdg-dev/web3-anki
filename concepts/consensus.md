### What problem does consensus in blockchain solve?
Getting all nodes in a distributed network to agree on the blockchain state without requiring a central authority.

### What are the two most popular mechanisms in blockchain to reach consensus?
<ol><li>Proof of Work (PoW): e.g. Bitcoin
</li><li>Proof of Stake (PoS): e.g., Ethereum</li></ol>

### How does Proof of Work work?
Miners compete to solve computationally intensive puzzles. The first to solve it gets to add the next block and receives rewards. The network accepts the longest valid chain.

### What are the trade-offs of Proof of Work?
pros:<br>+ battle-tested security<br>+ truly decentralized<br>cons:<br>- high energy consumption<br>- slow transaction speed

### How does Proof of Stake work?
Validators are chosen to propose blocks based on their stake (ownership) in the network. Validators risk losing their stake if they act maliciously.

### What are the trade-offs of Proof of Stake?
pros:<br>+ energy-efficient<br>+ faster transactions
<br>cons:<br>-&nbsp;potential centralization (wealthy validators have more power)<br>- newer/less proven
